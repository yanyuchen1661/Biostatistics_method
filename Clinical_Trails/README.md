# Epidemiology
## Epidemiology 

**Defination**: The study of the distribution and determinants of health related states or events in specified populations and the application of this study to control health problems.
- States
  - Diabetes 
  - Asthma
  - Epilepsy
  - Level of fitness
- Events
  - Abnormal blood sugar test
  - Shortness of breath attack
  - Seizure
  - A visit to the gym
- Disease：
  - In Individuals
    - Ask person
    - Ask doctor
    - Medical records
    - Perform examination
    - Conduct laboratory tests
  - In population
    - Surveillance
    - Reporting
- Distribution difference
  - Endemic: constant low level of a disease in some group or area.
  - Epidemic: high level in a population 
  - Pandemic: widespread even worldwide
  - Rare disease: less than 200,000 persons in US by Rare Disease Act; doctor cannot see that disease more than once a year by Wikipedia
- Control health problems
  - Primary
    - Passive
      - Fluoridation, 
      - Air bags
      - Folic-acid fortified bread
    - Active
    	- Fluoride mouth wash
	- Seat belts
	- Use of vitamin supplements
  - Secondary: 
    - Pap smears
    - Mammography
    - Diabetes control
    - Hypertension control
  - PKU screening
    - Tertiary
    	- Treatment of disease
	- Rehabilitation therapy

## observational study
### Propensity score
- [WHAT]
- It is the conditional probability that a subject receives “treatment” given the subject’s
observed covariates.
-	
- [WHY] 
- Randomized controlled trials have no confounding
- Observational study have confounding, due to treatments are not applied randomly (for patients could have some attributes differ from ordinary people), leading to selection bias and confounding variables.
- Mimic what happens in randomized controlled trials (RCT’s) by balancing observed covariates between subjects in control and treatment study groups(Faries, Leon, Haro, Obenchain, 2010).
- [HOW] 
- Given the observed covariates, matching observations from each group based on the probability that a patient received the medicine 
- Isolate the treatment as the only difference between our treatment and control groups
- Improved confounding variable balance between treatment and control groups
