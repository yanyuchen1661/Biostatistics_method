# Epidemiology
## Defination
- The study of the distribution and determinants of health related states or events in specified populations and the application of this study to control health problems.
    - States
        - Diabetes
        - Asthma
        - Epilepsy
        - Level of fitness
    - Events: 
        - Abnormal blood sugar test
        - Shortness of breath attack
        - Seizure
        - A visit to the gym
    - Disease
        - In Individuals 
            - Ask person
            - Ask doctor
            - Medical records
            - Perform examination
            - Conduct laboratory tests
        - In population: 
            - Surveillance
            - Reporting
    Distribution:
            Endemic: constant low level of a disease in some group or area.
            Epidemic: high level in a population
            Pandemic: widespread even worldwide
            rare disease: less than 200,000 persons in US by Rare Disease Act; doctor cannot see that disease more than once a year by Wikipedia
		Control health problems
			Primary
				Passive: Fluoridation, Air bags, Folic-acid fortified bread
				Active, Fluoride mouth wash, Seat belts, Use of vitamin supplements
			Secondary: Pap smears, Mammography, Diabetes control, Hypertension control, PKU screening
			Tertiary: Treatment of disease; Rehabilitation therapy
			
	Experimental study (gold standard)_Clinical trials
		Characteristic:
		Conditions under direct control
		Randomize individuals to be either exposed or unexposed
		Ethics: the strong temptation to subordinate the subjects’ welfare to the objectives of the study; 
		Limitation:
			Homogeneous population
			May not be generalizable to the entire people
			Woman, kids, elders are excluded
			Cannot randomize all exposures of interest
			
	Cohort study: Selection based on group membership or exposure status
		Directionality: forward (Exposure status before disease)
		Types(difference in data collection): Prospective or retrospective data collection? 
			Prospective: study start in the beginning
				Advantages: Under control purposely; temporality of exposure and disease is well- established
				Disadvantages: Costly, time consuming
			Retrospective: study start in the ending
				Advantages: Less costly, Less time consuming
				Disadvantages: Cannot fit your purpose
		Measures of frequency and association (Risk& Rate)
				Rate(using if people move in and move out… risk is not accurate)
					Unit: per XXX PY 
				Difference between rate and risk:
					Risk: 10 cases per 100,000 persons over 1 year (= 0.0001 = 0.01%)
					Risk over 5 years? 50 per 100,000 persons over 5 years
					Rate:10 cases per 100,000 person-years
				Risk ratio: Determine individual, but consider burden of society, the situation may change.
				Risk difference: determine public health importance of a disease
				Expression:
					 Risk ratio: The risk of disease among the exposed is X times the risk of disease among unexposed.
					Risk difference: XX per XXX cases of (disease) would not have occurred if exposure to (exposure) was eliminated.
					Rate ratio: The rate of disease among the exposed is RR times the rate of the unexposed over study follow-up.
		Advantages/Disadvantages
			Can study several diseases/ Time consuming
			Useful for examining rare exposures/ Inefficient for rare disease or long period illness
			Temporality: exposure occurred before the disease/ Loss of subjects
			
	Case control studies: Selection based on disease status
		Directionality: backward: determine the exposure status of the cases and controls, comparing  disease with and without existing exposure
		Measures of frequency (none) and association
			Odds ratio
				Expression: The odds of exposure(eating at the salad bar) among disease (individuals with diarrhea) is 3.1times the odds of exposure(eating at the salad bar) among no disease(guests without diarrhea )
				*OR approximate the RR when…
					Exposure in controls represent the exposure distribution in the source population
					Cases must be incident cases
					Disease must be rare
		Preferable to enroll incident (versus prevalent) cases 
			If exposure is associated with decreased survival, we may miss many exposed cases and underestimate the true relationship between exposure and disease 
			Reduces chance of survival bias
		Advantages/ disadvantages
			In hospital :easy to find, willing to participate/ exposure distribution may not be the same as the source population
			In community controls: exposure distribution much more likely to be the same as the source population/ expensive, time consuming, introduce selection bias
			General: cheaper and quicker; useful for study rare diseases; sample size is smaller than for cohort studies; allow for study of several exposure; rapid conclusion./ only study one disease at a time; cannot directly estimate the risk of disease; careful consideration is required for selecting controls because it may lead to biased results. Not useful for studying rare exposure; temporality of exposure and disease may not be certain; higher potential for bias, weakest study design (Higher potential for bias).
	
	Cross-sectional studies
		properties
			Exposure and disease are assessed at the same time
		Measures of association:
			Prevalence ratio and prevalence difference(existing depression)
			Prevalence (E+)=A/ A+C, Prevalence (E-)=B/ B+D, Prevalence(cohort)=(A+B)/ Total
			Prevalence-based	E+	E-	
			D+	A	B	A+B
			D-	C	D	C+D
				A+C	B+D	Total
		Expression
			The prevalence of disease among the exposed is 1.4 times the prevalence of disease among the unexposed 
			The difference in the prevalence of disease among the exposed versus the unexposed is 0.014
		Advantages
			Relatively quick and inexpensive
			Can generate pilot data for a study with clear temporality between exposure and disease
			Evaluate several exposures and diseases at the same time
			Helpful for evaluating the disease burden and exposure burden in a population(prevalence)
		Disadvantages
			temporal sequence unclear
			May miss diseases or exposures with short
			
	Random error: can be reduced by increasing sample size, but cannot eliminated the effects of uncontrolled bias or confounding
		Types of random error:
			Type I (alpha,0.05) error(no relation but we say have relation)
			There is 5% chance that we will say there is an association when there is not. The researcher is willing to accept a 5% risk of committing falsely concluding that the groups differ when in reality they do not.
			Type II (beta,0.2) error(have relation but we say doesn't have relation)
			There is a 20% chance that we will say there is no association, when there actually is. Study has an 80% chance of detecting a specified difference in outcome between the treatment groups.
		Statictical inference(Assess random error) : the process of quantify random error
			use p-value (determine results with null hypothesis): 
				Definition: 
				the probablity of observing a result as strong as or stronger than the one that was observed  if the null hypothesis were true.
				Determinents:
				magnitude of the association and sample size
				Principles:
					Describe pattern of observation; indicate how incompatible data are with specified statistical model 
					Does not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true or produced by chance alone
					A small difference may be statistically significant in large sample size
				Interpretation: If P is small, rejcet H0 and assume that it is unlikely that the result we observed was due to chance along.
				E.g. >5% probability that you would observe an RR of 3 or greater if there was actually no association in the population, not statistically significant
			Interval estimation
				Precision: wider intervals meaning less precise
				Statistical significance: Interval contains null value,  p>=0.05, not statistically significant; Not contains null value,  p<0.05
				95% confidence interval: 
					Confidence interval meaning:
					a level of certainty about our estimate. 
					Funtion:
					Only way to represent how good an estimate is
					Interpretation:
					if repeated indefinitely, would result in 95% of the confidence intervals formed containing the true value
				
	Selection bias(subjective)
		Origin:
		Occurs when an different effect (relative risk, risk difference) bewteen estimated from the available study population and estimated from source population.
		Source:
			Case-control studies
				The manner in which cases, controls, or both are selected 
				E.g. Exposed cases are more likely to participate than unexposed cases, and exposure is a risk factor(Overestimate)
				Selection of prevalent (versus incident) cases can cause bias
				E.g. If prevalent cases are selected and exposure affects disease prognosis, duration, and/or survival (e.g., selective survival)
			Cohort and Clinical Trials
			loss to follow-up, withdrawal from the study, or non-response
			E.g. Exposed people who develop the disease drop out at a higher rate than exposed people who don’t develop the disease, and exposure is a risk factor (Underestimate)
			Cross-sectional studies
			selective survival
			E.g. Prevalent diseased with the exposure are more likely to die than prevalent non-diseased with the exposure(Underestimate)
		Fix Selection bias in design process
			Randomization 
			High participation rates(In longitudinal studies)
			Complete follow up(In longitudinal studies)
			Appropriate controls (case-control)
			Use incident cases (case-control)
		Fix Selection bias in data analysis process
			Correction using selection probabilities
			
			sensitivity analysis
				allows for the assessment of the possible role of selection (or information) bias
				Asks: If a given bias were present, what would be the effect on the measure of association?
		
		
	Information bias(subjective)[issue of Internal validity (and therefore also external validity)]
		Origin:
		Occurs when measurement of the exposure and/or measurement of the outcome is inaccurate
		Source:
			Misclassification of Exposure
				Imprecise measurement: Poorly constructed questionnaire questions; Faulty measurement device
				Interviewer bias
			Misclassification of Disease
				Incorrect diagnosis :Inadequate technology; Laboratory error; Disease is subclinical 
			Subject’s self-report : Incorrect recall; Reluctant to be truthful
			Incorrect coding of disease data
		Fix Information bias in design process
			Blinding 
			Minimize reliance on recall 
			Standard data collection 
			Whenever possible use objective measures of exposure and outcome 
			Whenever possible, use gold standard/advanced exposure and disease assessment techniques 
		Fix Information bias in analysis process: Correction using sensitivity and specificity estimates 
			Disease and exposure misclassification table
			Non-Differential misclassification of disease: cut exposure into two table, verse visa. 
						
						Sensitivity = a / (a+c), Specificity = d / (b+d)
			
			Non-differential misclassification:(Differential ≠, bias can be in either direction)
					Of the exposure: 	 Se (D) = Se (D-) and Sp (D) =  Sp (D-) 
					Of the disease:     	 Se (E) = Se (E-)  and Sp (E)  =  Sp (E-) 
					
			
						
				If misclassification is only non-differential, bias is towards the null
	Confounding(quantifiable)
		Origin:
		Occurs when the measure of association is distorted because of an extraneous factor that is not balanced between comparison groups.
		Fix Comfounding in design process
			Randomization 
			Matching (must also conduct a matched analysis)
			If matched case-control: mOR = X/Y
						control	control
						exposed	unexposed
				case	exposed	W	X
				case	unexposed	Y	Z
			Restriction
			Priori criteria- confounding triangle: (Use OR regardless of study type to assess:)
			Maternal age is a confounder of the association between birth order and DS
				must be a risk factor for outcome (not caused by the outcome): 
				*In matched case-control study, we break arrow 1 by balancing confounders between cases and controls.
				Eg. Maternal age appears to be a risk factor for Down syndrome. 
				must be associated with exposure: 
				*In RCT, we assign people to exposure, thus breaking the link of confounder and exposure.
				Eg. Birth order’s association with Down syndrome is confounded by maternal age.
				cannot be an intervening variable
				Eg. Birth order’s association with Down syndrome is null after controlling for maternal age. 
							
			Data-based criterion method(before analysis 10% rule: [(crude – adjusted) / adjusted] *100> 10%, then confounding)
				Stratify data on the possible confounder
				Compute and compare stratum-specific measures of association
				If stratum-specific measures of associations are similar, compute a confounder adjusted measure of association 
				If there is a meaningful difference between “crude” and confounder “adjusted” measures of association, then there is confounding (No confounding zone” = (aOR + 0.1*aOR))
			Expression:
					(2.15 – 1) / 1 = 1.15 * 100 = 115% difference 
					aOR and cOR are meaningfully (>10%) different 
					Smoking is a confounder based on the data-based criterion method
			Joint confounding
				Sex or race?
				
				Sex and race Jointly?
				
				Summary of findings 
						Crude RR = 
						RR adjusted for sex only = 
						RR adjusted for race only = 
						RR adjusted for sex and race jointly = 
				 Conclusions 
					Evidence of joint confounding by sex AND race; No evidence of confounding by sex OR race; We have to control for both sex and race 
					The joint confounding by MA and PC is the same as confounding by MA or PC alone, It is sufficient to control for MA or PC; no need to control for both
					There is joint confounding by MA and PC which is the same as confounding by MA, but not PC; It is sufficient to control for MA only, but not for PC only
				
		Fix Comfounding in data
			Restriction
			Adjustment
				Simple
				Weighted sample size
					
		
			Modeling (more about this later)
		Residual confounding is confounding that remains after attempting to control for confounding 
			Additional confounding factors exist that were not controlled for (e.g., if unknown, not measured) 
																					
			Control of confounding was not precise enough (e.g., controlling for age categorized as “old” vs. “young” may not entirely control for confounding by age) 
			Misclassification of confounder measurement (information bias!) 
			
	Interaction (strata-specific heterogeneity)
		Defination
			One exposure: occurs when the measure of association between exposure and disease depends on another variable
			Two exposure: occurs when the observed measure of association of two variables combined is different than their expected combined effect had they been acting independently 
		Properties (two scale)
			1: Multiplicative interaction describes differences in stratum specific ratio measures of association (e.g., RR or OR) 
			0: Additive interaction describes differences in stratum-specific difference measures of association (e.g., RD)
		Interaction example: 
				White		Black		Asian	
				Yes(Drink Alcohol?)	No	Yes	No	Yes	No
			Cases	72	41	93	54	68	33
			Controls	106	105	113	113	78	142
			
			
			if stratum-specific measures of association are different (we only need stratum-specific OR), and must report the stratified measures of association. 
			Conclusion: There is evidence of interaction by race on the multiplicative scale (would want a Breslow-Day test to verify) Report stratum specific measures of association, 
		solutions: 
			Heterogeneity approach(DEF.1)
				Stratify data by the possible interaction variable
				interpretation: The effect of alcohol on liver cirrhosis is different for different races
				
								
			Expected combined effect approach(DEF.2)
				calculate the:
					Observed combined measure of association for exposures 1 and 2
					Expected combined measure of association for exposures 1 and 2
				What is the expected measure of association on the additive scale? 
					RD1 + RD2 (RD could signify either risk or rate difference)
				What is the expected measure of association on the multiplicative scale? 
					RR1 *  RR2 (RR could signify either risk or rate ratios)
					OR1 *  OR2
				Is the observed combined measure of association different from the expected?
					Does RD1 + RD2 = RD12 ? If not, then additive interaction is present
					Does RR1 *  RR2 = RR12 ? If not, then multiplicative interaction is present (or OR in a case-control study)
				If there is interaction: 
					Is the observed measure of association larger than expected?  Synergy
					Is the observed measure of association smaller than expected?  Antagonism
						
			
	Interaction and confounding
			
	Screen and diagnostic test
		Two types of test
			Screening test
			Establishes or rules out disease in individuals who appear healthy, but may be at risk 
			Diagnostic test
			Establishes or rules out disease in individuals with abnormal signs or symptoms
		reliability
		Percent agreement
						
							
		Se and Sp, PPV and NPV:
			Se and Sp(accuracy of a test, property of the test) are typically considered the properties of the test; 
			whereas PPV and NPV (estimation of probability of disease) depend on both the test and the disease frequency (prevalence).
							
			
	Small Points
		Study validity：Absence of bias
			Internal validity: are you measuring what you think you are measuring? (accuracy)
				Measures to improve: restrict type of subjects or the environment in study
				These measures decrease the impact of factors extraneous to the question of interest but also decrease generalizability
			External validity: do your results apply beyond your study? (generalizability)
				This inference requires judgments about findings from other studies and their connection to our study
				Less quantifiable than internal validity
		Ecologic fallacy
				Suspected risk factor and disease are associated at the population level, but not at the individual level. 
				Not the same persons being affected by both conditions, but in population, both show high level indicating correlations.
		Analytic Difference with descriptive : draw comparison
				Exposure: the disease experience of the exposed is compared to that of the non-exposed
				Outcome: affected by disease is compared to that of those who are not affected
		HEALTHY WORKER EFFECT
				Because the general population also contains many people who cannot work due to ill health 
				 Work force tends to have fewer sick people


## observational study
### Propensity score
- [WHAT]
- It is the conditional probability that a subject receives “treatment” given the subject’s
observed covariates.
- [WHY] 
- Randomized controlled trials have no confounding
- Observational study have confounding, due to treatments are not applied randomly (for patients could have some attributes differ from ordinary people), leading to selection bias and confounding variables.
- Mimic what happens in randomized controlled trials (RCT’s) by balancing observed covariates between subjects in control and treatment study groups(Faries, Leon, Haro, Obenchain, 2010).
- [HOW] 
- Given the observed covariates, matching observations from each group based on the probability that a patient received the medicine 
- Isolate the treatment as the only difference between our treatment and control groups
- Improved confounding variable balance between treatment and control groups
-
