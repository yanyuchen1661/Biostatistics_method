# Epidemiology
## Epidemiology

**Defination**: The study of the distribution and determinants of health related states or events in specified populations and the application of this study to control health problems.

- States
  - Diabetes 
  - Asthma
  - Epilepsy
  - Level of fitness
- Events
  - Abnormal blood sugar test
  - Shortness of breath attack
  - Seizure
  - A visit to the gym
- Disease：
  - In Individuals
    - Ask person
    - Ask doctor
    - Medical records
    - Perform examination
    - Conduct laboratory tests
  - In population
    - Surveillance
    - Reporting
- Distribution difference
  - Endemic: constant low level of a disease in some group or area.
  - Epidemic: high level in a population 
  - Pandemic: widespread even worldwide
  - Rare disease: less than 200,000 persons in US by Rare Disease Act; doctor cannot see that disease more than once a year by Wikipedia
- Control health problems
  - Primary
    - Passive
      - Fluoridation, 
      - Air bags
      - Folic-acid fortified bread
    - Active
    	- Fluoride mouth wash
	- Seat belts
	- Use of vitamin supplements
  - Secondary: 
    - Pap smears
    - Mammography
    - Diabetes control
    - Hypertension control
  - PKU screening
    - Tertiary
    	- Treatment of disease
	- Rehabilitation therapy
	
## Clinical trails

- Characteristic
  - It is the gold standard
  - Conditions under direct control
  - Randomize individuals to be either exposed or unexposed
- Ethics problem: the strong temptation to subordinate the subjects’ welfare to the objectives of the study
- Limitation
  - Homogeneous population
  - May not be generalizable to the entire people 
  - Woman, kids, elders are excluded
  - Cannot randomize all exposures of interest 

## observational study

### Cohort study

- Characteristic
	- Selection based on group membership or exposure status
	- Directionality: forward (Exposure status before disease)
- Types(difference in data collection): Prospective or retrospective data collection? 
	- Prospective: study start in the beginning
		- Advantages: 
		  - Under control purposely
			- Temporality of exposure and disease is well- established
		- Disadvantages
			- Costly
			- time consuming
	- Retrospective: study start in the ending
		- Advantages: 
			- Less costly
			- Less time consuming
		- Disadvantages
		 - Cannot fit your purpose
- Measures of frequency and association (Risk& Rate)
	- Rate(using if people move in and move out… risk is not accurate)
		- Unit: per XXX PY 
	- Difference between rate and risk:
			- Risk
				- 10 cases per 100,000 persons over 1 year (= 0.0001 = 0.01%)
				- 50 per 100,000 persons over 5 years
			- Rate: 10 cases per 100,000 person-years
		- Risk ratio: Determine individual, but consider burden of society, the situation may change.
		- Risk difference: determine public health importance of a disease
		- Expression:
			- Risk ratio: The risk of disease among the exposed is X times the risk of disease among unexposed.
			- Risk difference: XX per XXX cases of (disease) would not have occurred if exposure to (exposure) was eliminated.
			- Rate ratio: The rate of disease among the exposed is RR times the rate of the unexposed over study follow-up.
- Advantages
	- Can study several diseases
	- Useful for examining rare exposures
	- Temporality: exposure occurred before the disease
- Disadvantages
	- Time consuming
	- Inefficient for rare disease or long period illness
	- Loss of subjects
	

### Case control studies
	
- Characteristic
	- Selection based on disease status
	- Directionality: backward: determine the exposure status of the cases and controls, comparing  disease with and without existing exposure
	- Measures of frequency (none) and association
		- Odds ratio
			- Expression: The odds of exposure(eating at the salad bar) among disease (individuals with diarrhea) is 3.1times the odds of exposure(eating at the salad bar) among no disease(guests without diarrhea )
			- *OR approximate the RR when…
				- Exposure in controls represent the exposure distribution in the source population
				- Cases must be incident cases
				- Disease must be rare
	- Preferable to enroll incident (versus prevalent) cases 
		- If exposure is associated with decreased survival, we may miss many exposed cases and underestimate the true relationship between exposure and disease 
		- Reduces chance of survival bias
- Advantages/ disadvantages for three scenario
	- In hospital
		- Easy to find, willing to participate but exposure distribution may not be the same as the source population
	- In community controls
	- exposure distribution much more likely to be the same as the source population/ expensive, but time consuming and introduce selection bias
	- General: 
		- Cheaper and quicker; 
		- Useful for study rare diseases; 
		- Sample size is smaller than for cohort studies; 
		- Allow for study of several exposure; rapid conclusion.
		- But only study one disease at a time; 
		- Cannot directly estimate the risk of disease; 
		- Careful consideration is required for selecting controls because it may lead to biased results. 
		- Not useful for studying rare exposure; 
		- Temporality of exposure and disease may not be certain; 
		- Higher potential for bias, weakest study design (Higher potential for bias).
		
#### Propensity score

- [WHAT]
  - It is the conditional probability that a subject receives “treatment” given the subject’s
observed covariates.
- [WHY] 
  - Randomized controlled trials have no confounding
- Observational study have confounding, due to treatments are not applied randomly (for patients could have some attributes differ from ordinary people), leading to selection bias and confounding variables.
  - Mimic what happens in randomized controlled trials (RCT’s) by balancing observed covariates between subjects in control and treatment study groups(Faries, Leon, Haro, Obenchain, 2010).
- [HOW] 
  - Given the observed covariates, matching observations from each group based on the probability that a patient received the medicine 
  - Isolate the treatment as the only difference between our treatment and control groups
  - Improved confounding variable balance between treatment and control groups
 
### Cross-sectional studies
- properties
	- Exposure and disease are assessed at the same time
Measures of association:
	- Prevalence ratio and prevalence difference(existing depression)
			| Prevalence-based | E+ |	E- | |
			| --- | --- | --- |	--- |	
			| D+ | A | B | A+B |
			| D- | C | D | C+D |
			|	| A+C | B+D | Total |
	- Prevalence (E+)=A/ A+C, Prevalence (E-)=B/ B+D, Prevalence(cohort)=(A+B)/ Total
Expression
	The prevalence of disease among the exposed is 1.4 times the prevalence of disease among the unexposed 
	The difference in the prevalence of disease among the exposed versus the unexposed is 0.014
Advantages
	Relatively quick and inexpensive
	Can generate pilot data for a study with clear temporality between exposure and disease
	Evaluate several exposures and diseases at the same time
	Helpful for evaluating the disease burden and exposure burden in a population(prevalence)
Disadvantages
	temporal sequence unclear
	May miss diseases or exposures with short
