## Linear Regression
- Definition
  Relating dependent variables to independent variables
- Relation with other fields
  - Rooted in conditional probability
    - The expected value given the value of predictors
    - Given all relevent coverates, the expected value remains a random variable
  - generalized linear model
    - Function of Y is modeled as a linear function of the indendent variable
